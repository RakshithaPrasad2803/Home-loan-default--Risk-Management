# Home-loan-default--Risk-Management
The banking and financial industry plays a crucial role in providing loans to individuals and businesses. However, one of the major challenges faced by financial institutions is the risk of loan defaults, where borrowers fail to meet their repayment obligations. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to default is critical for minimizing financial losses and maintaining a healthy loan portfolio.

In this project, we train different models Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest that can predict whether customers are likely to default on their loans. This will allow financial institutions to make informed decisions regarding loan approvals and risk management.
